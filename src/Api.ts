      summary: `The Robotics olympics is an international contest where students from all around the globe compete and cooperate to solve worldâ€™s problems like global warming , recycling or 2019â€™s challenge: ocean cleaning, using their knowledge in robotics.
      For the 2019â€™s edition, we developed an app ecosystem in order to help referees and assistants to report the score of the match in real time. Also, the platform did the tournament  setup and progression. Solving challenges like a really crowded place where wifi networks wonâ€™t be realiable (despite of being in our own private network), we implemented a minimum communication system to minimize the latency of the network.

Going deeper on the architecture, the system has four components:
server,
operation room desktop app,
referee app
assistant app.
Since the server directly feeds the screens compositing a video with overlays and a real time video feed, we used Unity3D to do the composition and overlay placing & animation. For the operator app, we used Angular and Electron to get a desktop build of our web app, since we wanted to give the user a desktop experience and do not depend on browsers. Finally, for the mobile apps we used Ionic, and did a responsive design that works for both tablets and cellphones, since this was a key point: if any device failed, needed to provide a backup device, which could be from tablets to any cellphone.`,

      summary: `Argentum Online is a 24-year-old game developed in VB6. With the intention of migrating the code to C++, we decided to re-implement the user interface (UI) in a more modern language for easier maintenance and extension. This also served as a crucial step towards migrating the entire project from VB6 to C++.

      To accomplish this, I utilized a C++ library to run a browser and created an API for VB6 to manage all interactions within the game. However, there was a challenge as the JavaScript library was built for 64-bit systems, while VB6 only runs as a 32-bit process. To address this, I implemented a background process to run the web, developed an API in VB6, and synchronized both processes using shared memory.
      
      Given that keyboard and mouse inputs were captured in the VB6 process, while all UI interactions such as button presses were handled in a separate process, efficient communication was essential to synchronize both processes swiftly. This was crucial to ensure that players did not experience any lag or delay while playing.`,

      In this role, I initially joined to support the team with the application telemetry service and later transitioned to assisting them in migrating the application engine to a new one with a modern architecture.
      
      The telemetry service was responsible for collecting data from various suite services running on the system and reporting it to the backend.
      
      The original engine was a single-threaded, Windows-only process, and the migration involved transforming it into a cross-platform, multi-threaded process. The migration primarily entailed implementing existing tools into the new architecture. These tools could encompass anything required by any analytics software, ranging from simple select/join operations to the generation of PDF or Excel reports.
